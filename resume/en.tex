I realized my first year of alternation at Access France Sécurité. This company installs security systems in various establishments and supply services as the safety audit or the long-term service contracts. My work took place within the research and development department under the supervision of M Gabriel Emering, manager of the company.

I had to, at first, make an audit of the existing system. For landing in the observed problems, my work concerned two application softwares, IdServ and Id4Chrome, which replace the originals softwares.
